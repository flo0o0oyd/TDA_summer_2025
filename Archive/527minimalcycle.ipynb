    "I found the problem here: if I want to minimize cycle, I need my filtration steps to include the previous step, with such inclusion. For 2 parameter, this is inclusion from both directions, so it cannot be achieved: for example, the step of (2,3) does not include the step of (3,2), and vice versa. You can only look at the inclusion of a certain row or column, but this is meaningless because this is what single parameter persistent has already done."
