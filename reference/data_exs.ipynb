    "# Our Data\n",
    "In this notebook, I show the data we use for the project. The data is available to us in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ujlvwjenrugdnzusxb04p/AJY7nvba6xihgvzd0bjwCRk?rlkey=woyb4gojtiqhvazd6lablbj4g&st=gd1buut9&dl=0) (This was the link we used last summer, we'll likely keep using it, but that's why it's named \"2024\") and is from [Dimensions AI](https://www.dimensions.ai) as of 2021. In general, all fields are separated following the [ANZSRC standard](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-and-new-zealand-standard-research-classification-anzsrc/latest-release), and we work with them one at a time. The parent folder in Dropbox has three folders in it:\n",
    "1. **notebooks:** This has a bunch of example notebooks for various things. You can look through these if you want. If you're unfamiliar with networks, I especially suggest looking at the \"crash_courses/networks\" folder.\n",
    "2. **msi_demo:** Don't worry about this right now. We'll look at it later.\n",
    "3. **data:** Where the data is stored. This is what I'll focus on now.\n",
    "\n",
    "One extra thing I'll add now (since I don't know where else to put it) is that you don't need to download the data. Instead, you can copy a link to the file and use that. For example, a link from dropbox to one of the files is:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/a1t16rtialcw03n50ffkc/concepts_Zoology_608.csv.gz?rlkey=vjv60sfbhofbgvzfzdkrlurl1&st=eol4x1dm&dl=0\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it in Python, you change the \"dl=0\" at the end to \"dl=1\" which makes it automatically download when you hit the link and use the link as the file path. If it's compressed, you'll need to manually enter the compression information. For example, you can use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pd.read_csv('https://www.dropbox.com/...&dl=1', compression='gzip')\n",

    "\n",
    "* `b`: Backward citations. The number of articles that paper cites.\n",
    "* `i`: Forward citations. The number of articles that cite that paper.\n",
    "* `cd`: The CD index from [Funk and Owen-Smith (2016)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2366). A scale from -1 to 1. A value of -1 means a paper is consolidating, meaning it combines ideas from many other papers. A value of 1 means it's disruptive, meaning it introduces ideas that replace other work.\n",
    "* `cdnok`: \"CD no K\". The CD index without a k part. Similarly goes from -1 to 1, just is more likely to be closer to an extreme value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number is the number of years that is calculated for. For example, `i10` is the number of citations a paper gets after 10 years. "
