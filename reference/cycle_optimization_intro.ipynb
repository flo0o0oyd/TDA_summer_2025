    "# Finding and Optimizing Cycle Representatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent homology (PH) is one of the canonical TDA tools that can be used to better understand data. Typically, the PH process provides a macro-scale overview of the *global* topological structure of a dataset—the structure and lifetime of holes in the dataset—and does not contain *geometric* information about important topological features—where those holes are actually located. It is natural, however, to want to understand geometric properties of the topological holes, and this geometry can contain important real-world insights when contextualized in the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cycle representatives* seem like the solution to this problem. A cycle representative is a chain of simplices that surrounds a topological hole. Our ability to draw meaningful conclusions from cycle representatives suffers from a uniqueness problem; *any* chain of simplices that surrounds a hole is a cycle representative for that hole. Therefore, in big datasets a single hole can be represented by multiple cycle representatives that are potentially very different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal cycle representative is a unique[^1] cycle representative for a hole that minimizes some $\\operatorname{loss}$ function of the cycle. These optimal cycle representatives are useful, since they often hold some real-world meaning in the underlying dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives a brief intro to cycle optimization with code examples of how it can be implemented. The code can be (somewhat) complex, but all the code in this notebook should be functional so you don't need to perfectly understand the code to understand the cycle optimization concepts in the notebook. Some blocks can take longer (up to two minutes or so) to run. This can be sped up by running the code on a computer (instead of in Google Colab) or using a third-party optimizer (like Gurobi) which requires a license.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Usually. Some simplicial complexes, especially ones that have a discrete filtration, will not have unique cycle representatives."

    "# Preliminaries\n",
    "This notebook was created to be run in Python. We'll use the following packages throughout:\n",
    "- **Matplotlib.** Plotting library. You could also use plotly (like OAT does), but I have rendering issues occasionally with that.\n",
    "- **Numpy.** Useful numerical and array operations.\n",
    "- **Scipy.** Sparse matrix implementation.\n",
    "- **Pandas.** Dataframe operations. Most OAT results are dataframes which we can modify using pandas.\n",
    "- **Open Applied Topology (OAT).** Persistant homology calculations. Very transparent, which is useful for much of what we'll do in this notebook\n",
    "- **PuLP.** Frontend linear programming library. PuLP allows us to choose the backend we use to optimize. We'll use COIN, which I believe is installed by deafult. If it's not, see the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/coin-or/Clp).\n",

Gurobi and CPLEX are both much faster and free for academic use, Gurobi also has a python library gurobipy which can initialize problems much faster than PuLP."

    "Cycle optimization is an incredibly powerful technique that can help to derive meaningful insights from peristant homology. In theory, these techniques can be applied to any dimension cycle you want, but there are computational challenges for higher dimensions since the number of $n$-simplicies increases substantially for higher $n$ (To check, compare `len(dim_1_indices)` to `len(dim_2_indices)`).\n",
